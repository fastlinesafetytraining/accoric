Accoric Management is the only data management platform that connects with a safety training firm – Fast Line Safety Training –to provide a unified system compliance.

We are excited to release Accoric Management V. 3.1 this month, with a fresh new appearance, as well as with a few new futures. As always, we continue to focus solely on the construction industry, but also to maintain a close-knit relationship to our clients, so we can truly understand the problems they need solved. So, what’s new in Accoric Management V. 3.1?

## A Fresh Appearance, but Always Simple
We recreated everything to ensure the simplest, easiest-to-use application ever. We strive to make this a program that anyone can sign onto without a headache. Some of the first things you’ll notice is a softer typeface that’s easier to read, and a sleek sidebar to move throughout the program seamlessly. Small changes, but they feel better!

## History Section
A long anticipated feature: the history section. This new feature gives account admins clarity into who is making what changes on their account. Perfect for those that have a huge team of professionals accessing their account through their very own logins!

## New Spreadsheets
Customize and generate spreadsheets on your workforce with new options. Great for a finer view into your workforce. For example, click on “Category” under the Personal Information tab to see what employees belong to which category in your spreadsheet view. Or, change the visual appearance of your spreadsheet for easy reading.

## Certification Preview Window
By popular demand, we have updated the certification preview on the Employee Dashboard. Before, only valid certifications were previewed and listed on the front-facing Employee Dashboard. We received feedback numerous times, asking to recreate this preview window to something more streamlined. Now, a button, named, “Certifications,” is listed on the front-facing Employee Dashboard. Clicking on this button will prompt a pop-up window, where you can preview all certifications.
