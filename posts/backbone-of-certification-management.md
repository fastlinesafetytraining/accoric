*In today’s data-driven world, the efficient management and retrieval of information , such as certifications and other safety-related documentation, have become paramount for small and large construction companies. The ability to store and quickly retrieve such data is imperative to maintain compliancy to numerous local laws and other federal regulations, and to ensure overall safety on the job. But how exactly are information stored? What kind of technology is the backbone of the applications you use to track certifications and other documentation, such as Accoric Management?*

This is where relational databases and Structured Query Language (SQL) shine. These time-tested technologies form this backbone of data management, providing a robust framework for storing, organizing, and querying data. Ready to learn something new? In this article, we will explore how relational databases and SQL support the world of data management and why they remain indispensable tools.

## Understanding Relational Databases
Relational databases are a type of database management system (DBMS) that uses a structured approach to data management. Developed in the 1970s by Edgar F. Codd, this model revolutionized the way data is stored and managed. The key concept behind relational databases is the use of tables to organize data, with each table containing rows and columns.

## Key Characteristics of Relational Databases
- **Tables:** Data is organized into tables, with each table representing a specific entity or concept. In an example related to Accoric Management, we use tables for employees and their corresponding personal information.
- **Rows and Columns:** Tables consist of rows (also known as records) and columns (also known as fields). Rows represent individual data records, while columns define the attributes of those records. For example, an employee named John Smith and his phone number and email address is added into the relational database. Inside this relational database ads two columns: B, C, and D. Column B is named “Employee Name.” Column C is named “Phone Number.” Column D is named “Email.” So, when John Smith’s information is added, it is entered as thus:

- **Primary Keys:** Each table typically has a primary key, a unique identifier for each record. This ensures data integrity and enables efficient data retrieval. For example, John Smith’s record is labeled as “1.”

- Relationships: Relational databases excel at managing relationships between tables. Through foreign keys, tables can be linked to one another, allowing complex data associations.

*Relational databases and SQL have stood the test of time as the backbone of data management. They provide a structured, secure, and standardized way to store, organize, and query data. While new technologies and approaches have emerged, relational databases remain an essential tool for businesses and organizations that demand data accuracy, integrity, and reliability. As the world of data management continues to evolve, the foundational principles of relational databases and SQL will likely continue to play a pivotal role in shaping how we handle and leverage data.*
